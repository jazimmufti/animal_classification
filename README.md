# Animal Species Recognition and Classification

## Overview
The **Animal Species Recognition and Classification** project is an AI-based system designed to recognize and classify images of various animal species using computer vision and machine learning techniques. This project aims to build a model that can detect and identify different animal species based on images, making it a valuable tool for biological and environmental research.

The project leverages image classification methods to help researchers and enthusiasts alike to monitor wildlife and better understand animal populations in their natural habitats.

## Features
- **Animal Species Recognition**: The system identifies different species of animals from images.
- **Classification**: After training the model on a large dataset of images, the system classifies images into different animal species.
- **Real-world Application**: Useful in research, conservation, and education, especially in monitoring wildlife and studying biodiversity.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Collect a diverse set of images representing different animal species. This dataset should cover a wide variety of species, including mammals, birds, reptiles, etc.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the collected images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model training.
3. **Model Training**: Use a machine learning model (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks) to train on the labeled animal images.
4. **Testing and Evaluation**: Test the trained model on unseen images and evaluate its accuracy and performance.
5. **Deployment**: Once the model is trained and tested, the system can be deployed for real-time animal species classification using live camera feeds or uploaded images.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** or **PyTorch**
- **OpenCV** for image processing
- **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for visualizations
